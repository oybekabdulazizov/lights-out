# Lights Out - Game

🔥This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description 📝

This is my version of Lights Out game. To be completely honest, I would not say I have created this project by myself from scratch. Of couse, I used some help and resources from the internet 🥲

I hope you are aware of the game rules, that is, you need to switch all the lights off in order to win the game. This version may not be quite solvable and winnable yet, however, there is a little cheat trick you can follow in order to fake "win" the game and see the win message. 
No pressure though 😃

If you really want to win the game, go ahead and give it a try. 
😈 BEST OF LUCK!!!

But I am sure you wil be tired of trying soon anyway 😆

In case you are curious about the trick, follow the below steps. 

1. Pull the project into your machine, direct into the project folder, and run 
### npm install

2. Then, in your terminal (in the project directory), run 
### npm start 

3. In your browser, go to Chrome Store, find 'React Developer Tools', and install it into your browser. 

4. Once done, open the project in your browser, and direct to localhost:3000, considering the step 2 is still active.

5. Once opened the project in your browser, open Chrome Dev Tools, go to Components tab, and click on the Board component. 

6. There, you should see a state named 'hasWon' as false. Tick the box next to it. It should fake win the game, and show you the win message. 


Like I said earlier, no pressure 😄
